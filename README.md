Game Name: 
Cats-ronaut Burglars
(Yes, this is very creative but mostly straight to the point.)

Intent of Game: 
The intent of this game is to cure simple boredom by challenging ones hand eye coordination as they move the player around the screen and try to score points before the game ends.

Narrative Structure: 
The narrative structure of the game is very simple. The player plays a pair of cats using a net to transport diamonds into a rocket.

Mechanics: 
The player controls the cats using their mouse to move the net.

Aesthetics: 
The look of the game is pretty simple but it gets the point across. We have these two cats that are holding a block that is designed to mimic a net. We have a minecart that is shooting out diamonds seemingly at random and at different strenght as they don't all have the same trajectory as they leave the cart. There is a rocket that fires off as too many diamonds are missed and don't make it into the ship.

Joys and Struggles:
Some of the joys we found came from when scripts started to preform the tasks we wanted them to and we could see that the game was coming together nicely small steps at a time.
Some of the struggles came from whenever the code was working fine but then not knowing where it needed to go in relation to the game objects or even the scene itself at times for what we wanted it to do.

I worked on getting some of the basic scripts started like the throwing and the mine script so that we would have a base starting point. I worked on getting the overall gamemanager script to have all the needed parts that it needed so that there weren't so many cross script speaking in the seperate scripts themselves and instead it was being funneled through the gamemanager one. I worked on fixing some of the small errors that arose in the scripts themselves as there was progresses in writting them out. Most of the time the errors came about from my own doing and careless oversight but that is part of the learning experience right?
